The SU(0) Phase and Gauge Field Emergence in Causal Loop Cosmology
Abstract
Causal Loop Cosmology (CLC) posits that spacetime emerges from a discrete, relational graph under a thermodynamically guided rewrite rule, as demonstrated in prior works \cite{fisher2025, fisher2025triad}. This paper speculates on a pre-geometric "SU(0)" phase—a null graph with infinite relational symmetry—preceding the Acyclic Vacuum (Bethe lattice) of CLC. We hypothesize that symmetry breaking from SU(0) seeds the Bethe lattice, whose dual geometry (hyperbolic in the bulk, flat in the spectral/boundary frame) enables the emergence of gauge-like fields as edge fluctuations preserving geometric invariants. Leveraging the Global Register’s holographic constraints (Paper 2), we propose that these fluctuations mimic massless gauge bosons (e.g., photons), complementing matter fields as topological defects. We outline a simulation framework to test this hypothesis, extending Paper 3’s continuum limit to unify spacetime, matter, and gauge fields. While speculative, this work positions CLC as a comprehensive framework for quantum gravity, with falsifiable predictions for future validation.

1. Introduction
Causal Loop Cosmology (CLC) proposes that spacetime emerges from a discrete network of causal relations, without presupposing background geometry or fields \cite{fisher2025}. In Paper 1, we demonstrated inflationary geometrogenesis, where a primordial 3-cycle in an acyclic vacuum triggers geometric complexity, saturating at N_3 ≈ 42 due to a purity constraint \cite{fisher2025}. Paper 2 formalized the Necessary Triad—Acyclic Vacuum, Maximal Parallelism, Global Register—as logical consequences of relational axioms, ensuring consistent evolution \cite{fisher2025triad}. Paper 3 outlines the Continuum Limit Conjecture, anticipating convergence to a 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold (d_S → 4) \cite{fisher2025continuum}.
A key feature of the Acyclic Vacuum, approximated by a finite Bethe lattice (b=3, girth > log_3 N), is its dual geometry: locally hyperbolic (negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature, κ < 0) due to exponential volume growth (V(r) ~ 2^r), yet effectively flat (d_S → 4) in the spectral or boundary frame under the rewrite rule (\mathcal{R}). This unique symmetry, absent in random or lattice graphs, suggests a frame-dependent invariance that could underpin gauge field emergence. Inspired by this, we hypothesize a pre-geometric "SU(0)" phase—a null graph with infinite relational symmetry—whose symmetry breaking seeds the Bethe lattice. We propose that residual symmetries in the flat frame manifest as gauge-like fields, complementing matter fields as topological defects (Paper 3, §5).
This paper formalizes this speculation, defining SU(0), exploring the Bethe lattice’s dual geometry, and outlining gauge field emergence via edge fluctuations. We propose simulations to test these ideas, extending Paper 3’s framework to unify spacetime, matter, and gauge fields. The work is speculative, pending empirical validation, but aligns with quantum gravity principles (e.g., AdS/CFT \cite{maldacena1998ads}, LQG \cite{rovelli2004quantum}).
1.1 Motivation
The SU(0) hypothesis is motivated by the need for a complete theory unifying spacetime and matter. The Bethe lattice’s dual geometry suggests a symmetry capable of supporting gauge fields, analogous to U(1) invariance for photons. Symmetry breaking from SU(0) parallels the Higgs mechanism, where a featureless state differentiates into a structured vacuum, potentially generating both massive matter fields and massless gauge fields.
2. The SU(0) Phase: A Pre-Geometric State
We define the SU(0) phase as a pre-geometric state with no nodes or edges, represented by a null graph (\mathcal{G}_0 = (\emptyset, \emptyset)).
2.1 Definition
Definition 2.1 (SU(0) Phase): The SU(0) phase is a state of infinite relational symmetry, where no causal distinctions (nodes, edges, or directions) exist. Its adjacency matrix is trivial ((\mathcal{A}_0 = 0)), and all possible graph configurations are equivalent under transformations (e.g., adding/removing nodes).
This state lacks dynamics, as the rewrite rule (\mathcal{R}) (Paper 1) requires a graph structure. We hypothesize a symmetry-breaking event—introduction of a minimal causal structure (e.g., a single node or edge)—to transition to the Acyclic Vacuum:
[\mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}_1 = (V_1, E_1), \quad |V_1| = 1, \quad |E_1| = 0 \text{ or } 1.]
2.2 Symmetry Breaking
The transition resembles the Higgs mechanism, where a symmetric high-energy state breaks to a vacuum with specific properties. In CLC, the SU(0) phase’s infinite symmetry breaks when a causal relation (e.g., an edge) is introduced, seeding the Bethe lattice (b=3, girth > log_3 N). The free energy functional ((\Delta F = \alpha \Delta \rho_C - T \Delta S)) could drive this, with (\Delta \rho_C = 1) for the first edge and (T \to \infty) reflecting infinite entropy in SU(0).
Conjecture 2.1 (SU(0) Transition): The Acyclic Vacuum emerges from SU(0) via a symmetry-breaking event, introducing a minimal causal structure that evolves under (\mathcal{R}) to form a b=3 Bethe lattice with hyperbolic geometry.
3. Dual Geometry of the Bethe Lattice
The Acyclic Vacuum’s unique symmetry—hyperbolic in the bulk, flat in another frame—is central to gauge field emergence.
3.1 Hyperbolic Geometry
The Bethe lattice is locally tree-like, with volume growth V(r) ~ (b-1)^r (b=3, ~2^r). This yields negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature:
[\kappa(u,v) = 1 - \frac{W_1(m_u, m_v)}{d_{\text{graph}}(u,v)} < 0,]
where W_1 is the Wasserstein-1 distance between neighbor distributions \cite{ollivier2009}. This hyperbolic geometry supports local dynamics, such as 3-cycle formation (Paper 1).
3.2 Flat Geometry
In the spectral or boundary frame, the Bethe lattice appears flat:

Spectral Dimension: The random walk return probability yields:[d_S(G_t) = -2 \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\log \langle P_v(t) \rangle_v}{\log t} \to 4,]as anticipated in Paper 3 (§4), reflecting a flat manifold.
Boundary Projection: The Global Register’s holographic encoding (Paper 2) projects bulk properties to a conformally flat boundary, akin to AdS/CFT \cite{maldacena1998ads}.

Lemma 3.1 (Dual Geometry): The Bethe lattice exhibits hyperbolic geometry (κ < 0) in the bulk and flat geometry (d_S ≈ 4) in the spectral/boundary frame, a symmetry absent in random or lattice graphs.
Proof Sketch: The hyperbolic bulk follows from V(r) ~ 2^r, yielding κ < 0 \cite{lin2011}. The flat frame emerges via coarse-graining (spectral dimension) or holographic projection (register), as validated by Paper 3’s anticipated convergence.
3.3 Frame-Dependent Symmetry
This dual geometry represents a frame-dependent invariance, where transformations (e.g., coarse-graining, boundary projection) shift curvature without altering dynamics. This symmetry is hypothesized to underpin gauge field emergence.
4. Gauge Field Emergence
We propose that gauge-like fields emerge as edge fluctuations preserving geometric invariants (e.g., 3-cycle count, N_3 ≈ 42) in the flat frame.
4.1 Gauge-Like Transformations
Define a gauge transformation as a map (\phi: E \to E) preserving the adjacency matrix’s spectrum or 3-cycle count:
[\mathcal{A}{uv} \to \mathcal{A}{uv} + \delta \phi_{uv}, \quad \sum_{uv \in E} \delta \phi_{uv} \cdot \rho_C = 0,]
where (\rho_C) is the 3-cycle density. These fluctuations, enforced by the Global Register, mimic U(1) gauge bosons (e.g., photons).
4.2 Role of the Global Register
The Global Register (Paper 2) acts as a gauge-fixing mechanism, ensuring fluctuations are syndrome-free (consistent with purity constraints). This parallels QECC stabilizers \cite{kitaev2003fault}, encoding gauge fields as boundary excitations.
Conjecture 4.1 (Gauge Field Emergence): Edge fluctuations preserving N_3 in the flat frame (d_S ≈ 4) act as massless gauge fields, with dynamics governed by (\mathcal{R}) and stability enforced by the Global Register.
4.3 Unification with Matter
Matter fields, hypothesized as topological defects (e.g., deg(v) > 3 nodes, Paper 3, §5), interact with gauge fields in the hyperbolic bulk, with the flat frame mediating their continuum dynamics.
5. Simulation Framework
We outline a Python-based framework using SageMath 10.3, NetworkX 3.2, NumPy 1.26, SciPy 1.11, and POT 0.9 to test gauge field emergence.
5.1 Graph Generation
Generate 100 graphs from (\mathcal{G}_{3,1024,g}) (b=3, N=1024, girth > 7), as in Paper 3 (§3.1). Log metadata to ensemble_n1024_b3.csv.
5.2 Gauge Perturbations
Introduce edge flips as gauge-like fluctuations:
def introduce_gauge_fluctuation(G, fraction=0.01):
    num_flips = int(fraction * G.size())
    edges = list(G.edges(labels=False))
    for _ in range(num_flips):
        u, v = random.choice(edges)
        if G.has_edge(v, u):
            continue
        G_temp = G.copy()
        G_temp.add_edge(v, u)
        G_temp.delete_edge(u, v)
        n3_before = (G.to_undirected().adjacency_matrix()**3).trace() / 6
        n3_after = (G_temp.to_undirected().adjacency_matrix()**3).trace() / 6
        if abs(n3_after - n3_before) < 1e-6:
            G.add_edge(v, u)
            G.delete_edge(u, v)
    return G

7. Limitations and Future Work
The SU(0) phase and gauge field hypothesis are speculative, lacking dynamics in SU(0). Future work includes:

Formalizing SU(0) dynamics, potentially via quantum information principles.
Simulating gauge-matter interactions, combining edge flips with defect nodes.
Exploring a Hilbert space formulation to incorporate quantum superposition (Paper 3, §5).

8. Conclusion
This paper proposes an SU(0) phase—a null graph with infinite symmetry—whose breaking seeds the Bethe lattice’s dual geometry in CLC. The lattice’s hyperbolic-flat symmetry enables gauge field emergence as edge fluctuations, unified with matter defects. Planned simulations will test this, extending CLC toward a complete theory of spacetime, matter, and gauge fields.
