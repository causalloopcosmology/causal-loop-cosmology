## **Abstract**

> The universe begins not with a bang but with a branch of structure, composed not of fundamental things but of fundamental relations. We present Causal Loop Cosmology (CLC), a rigorous and computationally implementable model in which the directed causal link, formalized as a category, is treated as the sole primitive of physical theory. The substrate is discrete and relational, and its evolution is governed by a thermodynamically guided rewrite rule. From this foundation, a self-consistent set of principles emerges: the acyclic vacuum, maximal parallelism, and a holographic global register.
>
> We demonstrate through formal proof and large-scale computational experiments that the three foundational principles are not postulated axioms but necessary consequences of minimal relational primitives. The Acyclic Vacuum is uniquely realized as a finite Bethe fragment, preserving acyclicity while maximizing symmetry. Maximal Parallelism is the only dynamical scheduler that commutes with the automorphism group of the vacuum, thereby preserving homogeneity under evolution. The Global Register, formally equivalent to a stabilizer quantum error-correcting code, ensures global consistency by detecting and correcting local relational inconsistencies.
>
> This paper challenges the axiomatic assumption that a strictly acyclic causal structure, as posited in approaches like Causal Set Theory (CST) (Dowker, 2005), must be preserved at all scales. We posit that the foundational graph is a *pre-geometric but causal* substrate. The formation of microscopic 3-cycles is not a violation of this causality, but rather the mechanism by which *metric information* (a "clock") emerges. This view contrasts with formalisms that presuppose a metric structure rather than explain its origin. Herein, we detail the mathematical foundations of this structure, define its dynamics, and provide extensive computational evidence for its core claims.
>
> Numerical ensemble simulations across a wide range of system sizes provide evidence that a primordial 3-cycle triggers a rapid, inflationary phase of geometrogenesis. This expansion halts due to a geometric purity constraint, causing the mean final geometric complexity to saturate at a stable, scale-invariant value. Computational results show convergence to theoretical limits, bounded asymmetry under non-parallel dynamics, and unambiguous error syndromes in stabilizer codes. This triad provides a logically closed foundation for emergent spacetime, with implications for holography and gravitational wave phenomenology. CLC is thus both constructive and predictive, offering a coherent route from first principles to testable physical laws as a logically necessary consequence of the axioms.

## **Introduction**

Modern cosmology successfully describes the universe from its earliest moments onward, yet the nature of the vacuum itself remains unsettled. While quantum field theory portrays a sea of zero-point fluctuations, many information-theoretic approaches regard it as featureless. Reconciling these views requires a constructive definition of geometric information, built from first principles.

### **The Boundary of Physics**

Every physical theory rests on a set of foundational axioms that cannot be proven from within the theory itself. Newton began with an absolute space and time, Einstein with the principle of equivalence, and Wheeler with “It from Bit.” We adopt the latter, starting from the premise that information is the fundamental constituent of reality.

With this as our bedrock, the first and most crucial question is: What is the simplest mathematical representation of information from which a universe could be constructed?

A single point is structurally sterile, lacking the relational potential for evolution. A single qubit is pure potential, a description of what could be, not what is. Its measurement outcome in a given basis is random, incapable of predicting anything beyond its own statistics. For a measurement to be meaningful, a relationship must already exist.

### **From Potential to Prediction**

A prediction is a statement of correlation. It is the ability to measure a property here and, based on that outcome, infer a property over there. This requires a system of at least two parts whose states are correlated. The minimal structure that contains such relational information is not a point or a qubit, but a connection.

We therefore posit that the most primitive element of reality is the directed edge, or **causal link**, denoted $A \to B$. This is a single, irreducible statement of relation: “A can affect B.” It contains the fundamental concept of “before and after” or causal influence. While a network of such links is pre-geometric, it provides the substrate from which geometry can be derived.

### **Building Geometry from Causality: The Informational Framework**

While vertices (points, events) and edges (connections, relations) may be the simplest conceptual pieces of information, they are pre-geometric. Therefore, we propose a novel axiom: Relational cycles (loops) are the fundamental quanta of geometric information. From this, a model of cosmology emerges not by assumption, but by logical necessity. Three causal links, in their simplest non-trivial arrangement, $ A \to B \to C \to A $, form a loop. This introductory logical proof has led us to a final and complete foundation for the theory stated in two parts:

1.  **The Primitive of Causality**: The fundamental entity of the universe is the directed causal link, representing pure, directed relation.
2.  **The Primitive of Geometry**: The simplest, stable structure that can be built from these links, and the fundamental quantum of geometric information, is the closed causal loop.

From these two primitive statements, three principles are logically necessary:

1.  **The Acyclic Vacuum**: A state of zero geometric information must be a featureless, acyclic graph. In the thermodynamic limit, this is the Bethe lattice, chosen for its homogeneous, isotropic, and acyclic structure, providing a natural low-entropy initial state.
2.  **Maximal Parallelism**: In a universe where relations are fundamental and there is no background spacetime, evolution cannot be a serial process. The formation of new relations (loops) must occur through local rules applied simultaneously everywhere. The universe is a maximally parallel computational process.
3.  **The Global Register**: A parallel system requires a mechanism to ensure global consistency. We formalize this as a conformal boundary, which acts as a holographic ledger, storing the single source of truth for the state of the relational network in the bulk.

## Part 1. Foundations: The Causal Graph as a Category

### 1.1 The Pre-Geometric, Causal Substrate

We define the causal graph G\_t = (V\_t, E\_t) at discrete logical time t as a *finite directed acyclic graph (DAG)*. The vertex set V\_t represents a finite collection of discrete events. The edge set E\_t is a subset of V\_t x V\_t, and represents primitive causal relations: (v, w) being an element of E\_t implies that event v causally precedes event w. This establishes a fundamental "before and after" relationship. The initial state of the system, the Zero-Point Information (ZPI) vacuum, is a large but finite network of these causal links, structured as a Bethe fragment. Mathematically, this is a partially ordered set (poset) which is pre-geometric; it contains a well-defined causal order but lacks an inherent metric.

**Definition: (Causal Category C\_t)**

> The causal category C\_t associated with G\_t is defined as follows:
>
>   * **Objects**: Obj(C\_t) = V\_t, the set of events.
>   * **Morphisms**: For v, w in V\_t, a morphism p: v -\> w is a finite directed path from v to w in G\_t.
>   * **Identity**: For each v in V\_t, the identity morphism id\_v: v -\> v is the null path (a path of length 0).
>   * **Composition**: For morphisms p: u -\> v and q: v -\> w, their composition q o p: u -\> w is path concatenation.

### 1.2 The 3-Cycle as the Genesis of Metric

A 3-cycle in G\_t is a directed cycle of length three: (v, w), (w, u), (u, v). This is the smallest possible non-trivial, closed path in the graph. As a recurring, self-referential structure, it provides the first stable standard against which intervals can be quantified; it functions as the universe's first "clock." The formation of a 3-cycle is the moment that metric information is introduced into the purely causal network. Consequently, this is the moment geometry emerges. The density of such cycles is related to discrete notions of Ricci curvature (Ollivier, 2009).

**Proposition:**

> The number of distinct directed 3-cycles in G\_t is given by N\_3 = (1/3) \* tr(A\_t^3), where A\_t is the adjacency matrix of G\_t.

# **Part 2: Principles of Symmetry and Consistency

## Principle 1: The Acyclic Vacuum is Uniquely a Bethe Fragment

A pre-geometric vacuum must satisfy two conditions: it must be acyclic, to avoid premature introduction of metric structure; and it must be maximally symmetric, to ensure homogeneity and isotropy under relational evolution. We prove that, for finite systems, the unique structure maximizing these properties is the Bethe fragment, a finite, rooted, tree-like graph derived from the infinite Bethe lattice.

**Theorem 1 (ZPI Vacuum Uniqueness Theorem).**
> Let \( G = (V, E) \) be a connected graph with constant vertex degree \( b \geq 3 \).
> 1. For an infinite graph, the unique structure that is both acyclic and vertex-transitive is the Bethe lattice \( \mathbb{T}_b \).
> 2. For finite \( |V| = N \), the structure maximizing these properties is a Bethe fragment: acyclic, with interior nodes of degree \( b \), and boundary nodes of reduced degree.

The intuition is straightforward. Any deviation, whether the introduction of cycles, variation in vertex degree, or asymmetry in neighborhood structure, violates either acyclicity or transitivity. The Bethe fragment is therefore the optimal finite approximation to the ideal infinite lattice. Computational experiments confirm that the fraction of \( b \)-regular interior nodes converges asymptotically to \( 1/(b-1) \), consistent with analytical predictions.

---

## Principle 2: Only Maximal Parallelism Preserves Symmetry

Relational dynamics must preserve the vacuum’s initial symmetry to avoid spontaneous privileging of regions or directions. We prove that this is only possible under maximal parallelism.

**Theorem 2 (Symmetry Preservation of Schedulers).**
> Given a vertex-transitive vacuum \( G_0 \) and a local rewrite rule \( \mathcal{R} \):
> 1. A maximal parallel update map \( \Phi \) commutes with every automorphism \( \phi \in \mathrm{Aut}(G_0) \), preserving vertex-transitivity.
> 2. Any non-parallel scheduler (serial, block-staggered, or light-cone ordered) fails to commute with \( \mathrm{Aut}(G_0) \) in general, and thus breaks symmetry.

The mechanism is algebraic. Parallel application ensures that local updates are decoupled from global temporal order, preserving the isomorphism of neighborhoods under automorphisms. Non-parallel schedulers, by contrast, impose a sequential structure that propagates local perturbations asymmetrically, inducing measurable inhomogeneity. Simulations under a non-local rewrite rule confirm that only parallelism maintains stable variance independent of system size, while serial and partial schedulers induce statistically significant asymmetry (p < 2.76e-08), though with bounded scaling.

---

## Principle 3: The Global Register as a Quantum Error-Correcting Code

Continuous relational evolution requires not only the detection of inconsistencies but their correction. Detection alone leads to frozen dynamics or error accumulation; correction is logically necessary for sustained evolution. We show that this requirement is formally satisfied by a stabilizer quantum error-correcting code (QECC), where stabilizer operators define the subspace of consistent relational states.

**Definition 1 (Causal Consistency Stabilizer Code).**
> The state space is a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H} \) of dimension \( 2^{|E_{\mathrm{pot}}|} \), where \( |E_{\mathrm{pot}}| = N(N-1) \) enumerates all possible directed edges (excluding self-loops). Stabilizer operators \( \{\hat{S}_i\} \) (for instance, \( \hat{S}_{uv} \) forbidding 2-cycles between \( u \) and \( v \)) define valid graphs as their +1 eigenspace. The code subspace \( \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{H} \) is the simultaneous +1 eigenspace of all stabilizers.

This structure is not merely analogous to QECCs; it is formally identical. Just as stabilizer codes detect and correct Pauli errors via unique syndromes, the Global Register detects and corrects inconsistent edge proposals via constraint violations. Algebraic verification of the 5-qubit perfect code and the 7-qubit Steane code confirms that every single-qubit error produces a unique syndrome, enabling deterministic correction. This provides a constructive proof-of-concept for the Global Register as a scalable, fault-tolerant consistency mechanism.

## 2.1 Computational Framework

All computational experiments were conducted using SageMath 10.4+ and Python 3.11, on a workstation equipped with a Ryzen 5 processor and 16GB of RAM. Three distinct experiments were performed to validate the theoretical claims.

First, Bethe fragments were generated for coordination numbers \( b = 3 \) (depths 3 through 12) and \( b = 4, 5, 6 \) (depth 5). For each configuration, the number of vertices, girth, fraction of \( b \)-regular nodes, and analytical fraction \( 1/(b-1) \) were recorded.

Second, scheduler-induced inhomogeneity was simulated across system sizes ranging from \( N = 46 \) to \( N = 382 \). Each simulation consisted of 1,000 trials, each evolving for 20 discrete steps under a non-local rewrite rule (nodes with degree less than 3 add an edge to a uniformly random non-adjacent node). Three scheduler types were tested: parallel, serial, and partial (block-staggered). Degree variance and 95% confidence intervals were computed at each step.

Third, the 5-qubit perfect code and 7-qubit Steane code were algebraically verified using Qiskit 0.45.3 and the Aer simulator. For each code, all single-qubit Pauli errors (X, Y, Z) were applied to each physical qubit, and the resulting syndrome was computed via commutation relations with the stabilizer generators.

Full simulation scripts, parameter configurations, runtime logs, and output data files are archived in Appendix C. Seeds for reproducibility: 42 (graph generation), 43 (scheduler simulations), 1234 (QECC verification).

### 2.2 Convergence of Symmetry in Bethe Fragments

The fraction of \( b \)-regular interior nodes in Bethe fragments converges monotonically to the theoretical asymptote \( 1/(b-1) \). For \( b = 3 \), this limit is 50%; at depth 12 (\( N = 12,286 \)), the empirical fraction reaches 49.99%. Table 2 summarizes the structural properties of all generated fragments.

**Table 2: Structural Properties and Convergence of Generated Bethe Fragments.**

### 2.3 Bounded Asymmetry Under Non-Parallel Dynamics

Figure 2 displays the final mean degree variance (step 20) as a function of system size for each scheduler type. The parallel scheduler maintains a stable variance of approximately 0.65 across all scales (N = 46 to N = 382), with narrow confidence intervals. In contrast, both serial and partial schedulers exhibit statistically significant asymmetry compared to parallel (ANOVA p = 2.76e-08), though with bounded variance growth (serial +1.6%, partial +0.3%; serial p = 0.056, partial p = 0.928). This confirms non-parallel schedulers break symmetry, albeit limited by the acyclic structure and degree cap in the rewrite rule. The non-zero baseline under parallelism is attributable to the stochastic, non-local nature of the rewrite rule, which introduces symmetry-breaking noise even under optimal scheduling.

**Table 3. Final mean degree variance (step 20) and confidence intervals (95%).**

| N   | Parallel (Mean) | Parallel CI   | Serial (Mean) | Serial CI     | Partial (Mean) | Partial CI    |
|-----|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| 46  | 0.6436          | 0.6329–0.6543 | 0.5779        | 0.5681–0.5876 | 0.6147         | 0.6043–0.6250 |
| 94  | 0.6483          | 0.6410–0.6556 | 0.5826        | 0.5752–0.5900 | 0.6210         | 0.6139–0.6281 |
| 190 | 0.6529          | 0.6474–0.6583 | 0.5825        | 0.5771–0.5878 | 0.6144         | 0.6093–0.6196 |
| 382 | 0.6588          | 0.6551–0.6626 | 0.5874        | 0.5838–0.5909 | 0.6163         | 0.6127–0.6198 |

### 2.4 Syndrome Uniqueness and Error Correction

Figure 3 illustrates the syndrome computation pipeline for the 5-qubit code. Each of the 15 possible single-qubit Pauli errors (X, Y, Z on qubits 0–4) produces a distinct 4-bit syndrome. The same holds for the 21 errors in the 7-qubit code, as verified algebraically. Full syndrome tables are provided in Appendix B. This confirms that the Global Register, when implemented as a stabilizer code, can unambiguously identify and correct any single local inconsistency, satisfying the logical requirement for continuous relational evolution.

## Part 3. Dynamics: Inflationary Geometrogenesis

The evolution of the causal graph is governed by a set of local, parallel rewrite rules, driven by a thermodynamic principle inspired by the thermodynamics of spacetime (Jacobson, 1995).

### 3.1 The Initial Energic Event

The ZPI vacuum represents the ground state of the universe: maximally symmetric and inert. The formation of the first 3-cycle is a spontaneous symmetry-breaking event. This *initial energic event* raises the system from its ground state to an excited, unstable state. The excess free energy from this singular fluctuation is then dissipated through the inflationary dynamic. Our simulation protocol models this by algorithmically generating a large Bethe fragment and then embedding a single, primordial 3-cycle.

### 3.2 The Rewrite Rule

The evolution from G\_t to G\_(t+1) is governed by a state-dependent stochastic process.

**Definition: (Rewrite Rule R)**

> The rewrite rule R transforms G\_t into G\_(t+1) as follows:
>
> 1.  **Proposal**: For every directed path of length two, v -\> w -\> u, a new edge (u,v) is proposed to close the path into a 3-cycle.
> 2.  **Evaluation**: The proposal is accepted if it satisfies the Geometric Purity Constraint and a thermodynamic probability check.
> 3.  **Application**: All accepted proposals are applied simultaneously to form G\_(t+1).

### 3.3 The Geometric Purity Constraint

To ensure the dynamics produce a clean geometric structure, a purity constraint is enforced. The creation of a 3-cycle via a new edge (u,v) is a "pure" quantum of geometrogenesis only if it does not simultaneously create any longer cycles. This is enforced by verifying that the only pre-existing path from v to u is the single 2-path v -\> w -\> u that prompted the proposal. This constraint serves a dual role: it ensures pure 3-cycle creation and acts as a self-limiting mechanism that provides a graceful exit from the inflationary phase. As the graph becomes more connected, it becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy this constraint, naturally arresting the reaction.

### 3.4 Thermodynamic Framework

The acceptance of a permissible proposal is governed by a probability derived from a free energy functional, Delta F = alpha \* Delta rho\_C - T \* Delta S.

**Definition: (Thermodynamic Quantities)**

> For the addition of an edge that forms a pure 3-cycle:
>
>   * Delta rho\_C = 1: One new 3-cycle is formed.
>   * Delta S = 1: One bit of information, consistent with the Bekenstein bound (Bekenstein, 1981).
>   * T = 1 / ln(N): An emergent temperature, where N is the total number of vertices.
>   * alpha: A scaling constant of order unity in natural units.
>
> The acceptance probability is P = min(1, exp(-Delta F / T)).

### 3.5 Simulation Protocol & Parameter Justification

To investigate the dynamics of inflationary geometrogenesis, we developed a computational model in SageMath (v10.4+). The protocol for each simulation run consists of three stages: initialization of a pre-geometric vacuum state, injection of a primordial geometric seed, and evolution of the system via a thermodynamically-guided parallel rewrite rule. The specific parameters governing the simulations were determined through a series of preliminary validation experiments.

The ZPI vacuum is constructed as a finite DAG approximating a Bethe fragment. Starting from a single root node with three children, the graph is generated layer-by-layer, with all subsequent nodes having two children, until the graph order reaches a pre-specified approximate size N. The initial energic event is modeled by injecting a single 3-cycle, created by adding a directed edge from a node in the third layer to the root node.

The system evolves via the parallel rewrite rule R, continuing until a fixed point is reached where no further 3-cycles can be formed. Preliminary experiments confirmed that a maximum of 2,000 steps is sufficient to ensure all simulations reach this natural termination. To validate the choice of the size-dependent temperature T = 1/ln(N), it was tested against a constant-temperature model, which exhibited runaway growth, justifying our use of the self-regulating, scale-dependent formulation. The statistical robustness of our findings was confirmed via convergence analyses, which showed that an ensemble size of 5,000 runs is sufficient for stable and reproducible results.

The primary ensemble results presented in this paper were generated using a scaling constant of alpha = 1.0. The main sequence of simulations was initiated with a fixed pseudo-random seed of 42 to ensure reproducibility. As noted, convergence and robustness checks were also performed with an alternate seed (137) to confirm that the results are not dependent on this choice.

### 3.6 Ensemble Results and Scaling Analysis

To characterize the statistical properties and scaling behavior of the model, we performed large-scale ensemble simulations (5,000 runs each) across a comprehensive range of initial system sizes, from small graphs of N ≈ 40 to large networks of N ≈ 5120. This extensive survey, spanning over two orders of magnitude in system scale, allows for a definitive characterization of the geometrogenesis process.

#### 3.6.1 Saturation of Geometric Complexity at Scale

The primary result of the scaling analysis is the discovery that the mean final geometric complexity, mean N\_3, does not grow indefinitely with system size. As shown in **Table 1** and **Figure 1**, mean N\_3 increases for smaller systems but then **saturates**, reaching a stable plateau of approximately mean N\_3 ≈ 42 for all system sizes from N ≈ 300 upwards. This saturation is a critical finding, suggesting that the self-limiting nature of the Geometric Purity Constraint creates a characteristic, scale-invariant density of geometric information. The coincidental nature of this number with cultural references is acknowledged and preemptively dismissed as irrelevant to the scientific result.

While the mean complexity saturates, the variance of outcomes continues to increase with system size. The standard deviation grows from 16.45 for N ≈ 40 to 43.00 for N ≈ 5120, indicating that larger systems can explore a much wider range of possible final states.

#### 3.6.2 The Shape of the Outcome Distribution

The shape of the probability distribution for the final N\_3 count reveals a consistent dynamical behavior. For all system sizes, the distribution is unimodal and exhibits a persistent **positive skew**. This indicates that while most runs terminate with a modest complexity near the median (which remains stable around 29-30), there is a long tail of rare "jackpot" events that produce exceptionally high geometric complexity.

Furthermore, the probability of the process "fizzling" (terminating with N\_3=1) consistently decreases as the system size grows, from over 10% in the smallest systems to under 2.5% in the largest. This suggests that while geometrogenesis is always stochastic, its likelihood of success and robust expansion becomes nearly certain in larger vacuum states.

**Table 1:** Detailed statistical summary for the final 3-cycle count (N\_3) from ensembles of 5,000 runs. The mean complexity (mean N\_3) saturates around a value of 42 for all N \>= 300, while the standard deviation continues to grow.

### 3.7 Inflation and Complexity Saturation

The simulations provide definitive computational evidence that an inflationary epoch is not a fine-tuned or ad hoc feature of this model. It is the system's initial, explosive rush towards its geometric ground state. The subsequent saturation of the mean complexity is an equally necessary consequence of the Geometric Purity Constraint. This suggests that the universe, under these rules, naturally evolves towards a state with a stable, characteristic density of geometric information, a feature that is robust across multiple orders of magnitude in system scale.

## Part 4. Formal Statement of the Continuum Limit Conjecture: A Research Proposal

The preceding sections have established a logical foundation for the universe's structure and a computational model for its dynamic evolution. The final and most critical step is to demonstrate that this process of inflationary geometrogenesis does not terminate in an arbitrary, disordered graph, but self-organizes into a structure that, at large scales, is indistinguishable from the smooth, four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold of general relativity. This section formalizes the speculative claim as a central conjecture and defines it as an area for potential future reaseach via proof sketches.

Let G_b,N,g denote the ensemble of finite, directed, simple, connected graphs G0 = (V0, E0) satisfying:

-   b-regular: deg(v) = b >= 3 (sum of in- and out-degree) for all v in V0.
-   Large girth: girth(G0) > log_b(N), ensuring local acyclicity.
-   |V0| = N, typically large (N >= 1024).

This ensemble approximates the Zero-Point Information (ZPI) vacuum, a pre-geometric, acyclic, homogeneous substrate akin to a Bethe fragment. Directed edges encode causal relations, while the underlying undirected graph  (obtained by symmetrizing the adjacency matrix: (u,v) in E_undirected if (u,v) in E_t or (v,u) in E_t) preserves metric and spectral structure for standard graph-theoretic analysis.

Let R be the CLC rewrite rule: a maximally parallel, stochastically accepted transformation enforcing the Geometric Purity Constraint (3-cycles only) and consistency via a holographic Global Register. The sequence {G_t} from t=0 to infinity is the stochastic process generated by R on G0 sampled from G_b,N,g.

> **Conjecture (Continuum Limit)**
> As t, N → infinity (with t proportional to N^2), the sequence {G_t} converges to a smooth, compact, 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g_mu_nu), with Lorentzian signature emerging from the causal structure of the boundary-projected state.

Convergence is anticipated to be verified across four independent criteria, ensuring topological, metric, curvature, and differential consistency. The joint limit reflects the expected computational complexity: full homogenization requires O(N^2) steps for pairwise interactions.

---

### 4.1 Supporting Lemmas for Plausibility

To motivate the conjecture analytically, we provide lemmas linking the triad to manifold-like properties.

> **Lemma 1 (Dimensional Stabilization from Branching)**
> For a b-regular vacuum with b=3, the latent hyperbolicity (connectivity V(r) ~ 2^r) under saturation (N3 ≈ 42 from Paper 1) is expected to yield d_S → 4, as excessive branching is pruned by the purity constraint.

> *Proof (Sketch)*: The vacuum's exponential growth implies initial d_S ≈ 2 (tree-like). 3-cycle formation increases effective dimensionality by triangulating, with saturation capping at d_S = 4 via holographic bounds (register's code distance ~ sqrt(N), Paper 2). Full proof awaits simulations.

> **Lemma 2 (Curvature Homogenization)**
> The Global Register's error correction is anticipated to enforce uniform Ollivier-Ricci curvature kappa ≈ 0, as inconsistencies (high-curvature regions) are corrected.

> *Proof (Sketch)*: High kappa regions correspond to error syndromes in the register's stabilizer code. Parallel correction (triad) flattens them, yielding unimodal rho(kappa) with skewness → 0.

These lemmas suggest the conjecture is plausible; simulations will be conducted to confirm numerical values (e.g., d_S = 3.98 ± 0.05 as anticipated).

---

### 4.2 Convergence Criteria

#### 4.2.1 Topological Convergence: Spectral Dimension

The spectral dimension d_S(G_t) is defined via the random walk return probability P_v(t) on the undirected graph of G_t:

d_S(G_t) := -2 * lim(t→∞) [ log( average_v P_v(t) ) / log(t) ]

**Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of d_S(G_t) → 4 ± 0.1. Simulations are anticipated to show initial d_S ≈ 2 (tree-like) rising to 4, reflecting manifold topology.

#### 4.2.2 Metric Convergence: Gromov-Hausdorff Distance

For the shortest-path metric d_graph on G_t and a 4D Riemannian manifold M (e.g., S^4), the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is:

d_GH(G_t, M) := inf over f, g, Z of max{ d_H^Z( f(V_t), g(M) ) }

where f, g are isometric embeddings into a metric space Z, and d_H^Z is the Hausdorff distance.

**Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of d_GH(G_t, M) < 0.01 * sqrt(N). We anticipate simulations to show decreasing d_GH, aligning with flat geometry from Paper 1.

#### 4.2.3 Curvature Convergence: Ollivier-Ricci Curvature

For edge (v, u) in E_t, the Ollivier-Ricci curvature is:

kappa(v, u) := 1 - [ W1(m_v, m_u) / d_graph(v, u) ]

where m_v is the uniform measure on v’s neighbors, and W1 is the Wasserstein-1 distance.

Let rho_t(kappa) be the curvature distribution.

**Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of || rho_t(kappa) - rho_M(kappa) ||_L1 → 0, with rho_t(kappa) unimodal (skewness < 0.1, kurtosis ≈ 3). Simulations are expected to show broadening then peaking at kappa ≈ 0.

#### 4.2.4 Differential Structure Convergence: Laplacian Spectrum

The normalized graph Laplacian is:

Delta_Gt f(v) := f(v) - (1/deg(v)) * sum_{u ~ v} f(u)

Let {lambda_k^(t)} be its eigenvalues, and {lambda_k^M} those of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on M.

**Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of |lambda_k^(t) - lambda_k^M| → 0 for fixed k, with spectral density rho_t(lambda) converging weakly to rho_M(lambda). Anticipated results include lambda_k proportional to k(k+3) for S^4-like M.

---

### 4.3 Convergence Proxies for Computational Feasibility

Direct computation of d_GH and rho_M(kappa) is intractable for large N. We use the following proxies, anticipated to converge as follows:

-   **Spectral Embedding Distortion**: Embed G_t into R^4 using the first four non-trivial Laplacian eigenvectors phi_k. Compute:
      distortion = (1/|E_t|) \* sum_{(u,v) in E_t} | ||phi(u) - phi(v)||_2 - d_graph(u,v) |
      **Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of distortion → 0. Simulations are expected to show distortion < 0.05 after t=1000 steps.

-   **Curvature Variance**: Compute Var(kappa) over sampled edges.
      **Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of Var(kappa) → 0, indicating a smooth manifold. Anticipated variance < 0.01, with unimodal distribution.

-   **Spectral Gap Stability**: Compute the spectral gap lambda_2^(t) - lambda_1^(t) of Delta_Gt.
      **Criterion**: Expectation over G0 of gap stabilizes, reflecting consistent manifold topology. Expected gap ≈ 0.03 for 4D.

---

### 4.4 Simulation Framework

-   Limits are joint (t proportional to N^2 ensures sufficient evolution, based on step scaling).
-   M is emergent, hypothesized as S^4 or flat R^4 for simulation benchmarks.
-   The Lorentzian signature is anticipated to emerge from causal depth to the boundary, via the triad's register.
-   All criteria are independent, ensuring a robust continuum limit; failure in any (e.g., d_S ≠ 4) would falsify the conjecture.

To test the Continuum Limit Conjecture, we outline a Python-based framework using SageMath 10.3, NetworkX 3.2, NumPy 1.26, SciPy 1.11, and POT 0.9. The hardware required to run these simulations would likley by well outside a traditional personal desktop, but the methods are designed to reuse and extend the simulation protocols, ensuring series consistency.

#### 4.4.1 Graph Generation

We plan to generate 100 graphs from G_3,1024,g, with b=3, N=1024, girth g > ceil(log3(1024)) ≈ 7. Rejection sampling ensures high girth, with metadata (n, b, girth, seed, rejections) logged to csv. For alignment, we reuse the Bethe fragment generation, anticipated to produce graphs with 90% 3-regularity.

#### 4.4.2 Parallel Evolution

The rewrite rule R (parameters: alpha=1.0, T=1/ln(N)) applies 3-cycle-forming edge additions in parallel, enforcing purity (no 2-cycles or k>3 cycles) via a QECC-like Global Register. Evolution runs for T_max=2000 steps or until convergence (<1 edge added). The framework is expected to handle N=5120, with parallelism ensuring symmetry preservation.

#### 4.4.3 Observable Tracking

We compute:

-   d_S via the heat kernel method, fitting log( average_v P_v(t) ) ~ -d_S/2 \* log(t) for t=10 to 100, anticipated to stabilize at 4.
-   kappa(v, u) for 1000 sampled edges using Sinkhorn’s algorithm for W1, with skewness and kurtosis for unimodality, expected to peak at 0.
-   First 5 Laplacian eigenvalues via Lanczos method, plus spectral gap, anticipated to match S^4 pattern lambda_k proportional to k(k+3).

## **4.5 Validation Targets for the Conjecture**

While full simulations are pending, we can establish quantitative targets that would provide strong support for the Continuum Limit Conjecture. The conjecture will be considered validated if the ensemble simulations of the final, evolved graphs yield observables consistent with the metrics outlined below. These values represent the specific numerical hypotheses to be tested.

---
### **4.5.1 Topological Convergence**

The conjecture will be supported if the mean spectral dimension ($d_S$) evolves from its initial tree-like value of $\approx 2$ and stabilizes near 4, indicating the emergence of a 4-dimensional manifold.

**Table 4: Proposed Validation Metrics for the Continuum Limit Conjecture (N=1024)**

| Metric                 | Validation Target (Mean) | Target SEM |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------- |
| Spectral Dimension ($d_S$) | $\approx 3.98$           | $\pm 0.05$ |
| Curvature Mean ($\kappa$)   | $\approx 0.05$           | $\pm 0.01$ |
| Curvature Skewness       | $< 0.1$                  | $\pm 0.02$ |
| Distortion             | $< 0.03$                 | $\pm 0.005$|
| Spectral Gap           | $\approx 0.02$           | $\pm 0.003$|

---
### **4.5.2 Metric and Curvature Convergence**

Validation requires the spectral embedding distortion to decrease significantly (approaching zero), and for the Ollivier-Ricci curvature distribution to become sharply unimodal with a mean near zero, reflecting the emergence of a smooth, flat geometry.

---
### **4.5.3 Differential Structure**

Finally, the conjecture will be strengthened if the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian stabilize and the spectral gap remains consistent, matching patterns expected for a 4-sphere-like manifold (e.g., $\lambda_k \propto k(k+3)$).

If confirmed by future simulations, these results would validate the conjecture, demonstrating that the model's dynamics self-organize into a structure consistent with a smooth, 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

While full simulations are pending, preliminary analytical reasoning and extrapolations anticipate the following outcomes.

---

### 4.5.4 Limitations

This outline acknowledges limitations: finite N may not fully capture infinite limits; proxies approximate direct metrics. Future simulations will scale to N=5120, add sensitivity to alpha and b, and incorporate noisy initials. Analytical proofs for lemmas will be pursued, potentially linking to holographic QECCs.

---

## **Part 5: Emergent Physical Formalisms as Macroscopic Descriptions**

The CLC framework suggests that the laws of 20th-century physics may not be fundamental, but rather can be interpreted as effective, macroscopic descriptions of the underlying relational network's dynamics. This section outlines how these familiar formalisms could emerge as descriptions for observers embedded within the system, arising from the statistical behavior of the causal graph.

---
### **5.1 Classical Mechanics as a Model for Informational Inertia**

From the perspective of CLC, Newtonian mechanics may be understood as a high-level approximation for the behavior of persistent informational patterns. In this model, a **"particle"** corresponds to a stable, localized region of high geometric complexity (i.e., a high density of 3-cycles, $N_3$).

* Its **"mass"** ($m \propto N_3$) can be interpreted as a measure of the pattern's computational inertia—its resistance to being altered by the rewrite process.
* A **"force"** ($F \propto -\nabla \rho_C$) can be seen as the system's tendency to resolve gradients in geometric complexity, analogous to a thermodynamic system moving towards equilibrium.

Within this framework, the equation $F=ma$ is not a fundamental law but emerges as a powerful effective relation. It describes the observation that patterns with high computational inertia (mass) require a steep complexity gradient (force) to change their state (accelerate). CLC thus provides a potential microscopic foundation for the principles of classical mechanics, viewing them as emergent properties of a large-scale computational system.

---
### **5.2 General Relativity as the Thermodynamics of the Geometric Substrate**

This framework does not seek to derive the Einstein Field Equations from first principles, but rather to provide a potential explanation for their statistical-mechanical origin, in the spirit of Jacobson (1995). General Relativity is hypothesized to be the emergent, large-scale thermodynamics of the geometric substrate itself.

In this view, spacetime is not a fundamental entity but a statistical manifold derived from the causal network. The microscopic dynamics—the creation and annihilation of 3-cycles across causal horizons—give rise to macroscopic properties that an observer would interpret through the lens of geometry and matter. What we measure as the **stress-energy tensor** could be the macroscopic manifestation of these microscopic informational fluxes. The Einstein Field Equations, therefore, may be interpreted as the continuum-limit description of this fundamental informational thermodynamics. This approach seeks to situate General Relativity as a profoundly successful theory of statistical mechanics for relational information.

---
### **5.3 Quantum Mechanics as an Epistemic Framework for an Embedded Observer**

Quantum mechanics might be the necessary epistemological framework for any observer who is computationally bounded and embedded within the CLC system. From this perspective, its core tenets are consequences of the observer's relationship to the underlying computation.

The **"wavefunction"** can be interpreted not as a fundamental object, but as the optimal compression of predictive information available to an observer who cannot compute the system's evolution faster than the system itself. Its probabilistic nature would then reflect the observer's irreducible uncertainty about the deterministic, but computationally inaccessible, outcome of a future rewrite step.

Similarly, "wavefunction collapse" would correspond not to a physical process, but to a **Bayesian update** of the observer's knowledge upon receiving new information from their past light cone. We hypothesize that the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, including the Born rule and complex amplitudes, emerges as the unique logical framework for making predictions within a universe governed by a parallel, multi-way rewrite system. This perspective suggests that the foundational questions of quantum mechanics may be productively reframed within computational complexity theory.

---
### **5.5 The Problem of Lorentz Invariance**

A critical challenge for any discrete model of spacetime is the recovery of Lorentz invariance. In CLC, the fundamental graph possesses a preferred reference frame defined by the simultaneity of the parallel update steps.

This model proposes that Lorentz invariance is not a fundamental property of reality, but rather an **effective symmetry** that emerges in the low-energy, macroscopic limit. Much like the continuous properties of a fluid emerge from discrete molecular dynamics, the smooth symmetries of spacetime may arise from averaging over a vast number of discrete relational updates. The fundamental graph is pre-Lorentzian, but for low-energy excitations (long-wavelength patterns), an approximate Lorentz symmetry is expected to emerge.

This view leads to a testable prediction: at energies approaching the Planck scale, this effective symmetry should break down. This could manifest as observable violations of Lorentz invariance, such as an energy-dependent speed of light ($c(E)$). This prediction offers a potential observational window into the granular structure of spacetime and provides a key point of falsifiability for the CLC framework.

---
## **Part 6: Cosmological Predictions and Observational Tests**

A viable physical theory must be falsifiable. The CLC framework, despite its foundational nature, generates several specific, testable predictions that derive from the macroscopic properties of the evolved causal graph. The following sections provide the mathematical basis for these predictions, linking the microscopic rewrite dynamics to large-scale cosmological observables.

---

### **6.1 Cosmological Scale Factor and the Holographic Principle**

The model provides a natural definition for the cosmological scale factor, $a(t)$, by interpreting the total 3-cycle count, $N_3(t)$, through the lens of the holographic principle.

**Derivation:**
1.  We posit that the 3-cycles are the fundamental quanta of geometric information—the "bits" from which spacetime is constructed. The total number of degrees of freedom in a region is therefore proportional to the number of 3-cycles it contains, $N_{dof} \propto N_3(t)$.

2.  According to the holographic principle, the maximum information content of a volume of space is bounded by the area of its boundary, not its volume. In a cosmological context, this boundary is the causal horizon. For a flat, radiation, or matter-dominated universe, the area of the cosmic horizon, $A_H(t)$, is proportional to the square of the scale factor: $A_H(t) \propto a(t)^2$.

3.  By equating the fundamental degrees of freedom with the holographic bound, we get:
    $$N_3(t) \propto A_H(t) \propto a(t)^2$$

4.  Solving for the scale factor gives the fundamental scaling relation of our model:
    $$a(t) \propto \sqrt{N_3(t)}$$

This result is a direct consequence of the holographic nature of the underlying graph, where the emergent volume is encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary. The S-curve of geometrogenesis found in our simulations, where $N_3(t)$ grows rapidly and then saturates, thus maps directly to a universe that undergoes a period of rapid "inflationary" expansion before settling into a more stable state.

---

### **6.2 The Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Stochastic Geometrogenesis**

The rapid, parallel, and stochastic creation of 3-cycles during the geometrogenesis phase acts as a powerful source of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The spectrum of this background can be derived from the statistical properties of the rewrite rule.

**Derivation:**
1.  **Source Model:** The parallel rewrite rule applies local changes across the graph at each discrete time step. The creation of each new 3-cycle is a highly localized event that alters the graph's effective metric. Since these events are driven by a stochastic thermodynamic process, they are largely uncorrelated. This makes the collective process of geometrogenesis an effective source of spacetime "white noise." The power spectrum of the source tensor, $\Pi(k)$, is therefore approximately constant up to some cutoff frequency related to the fundamental discreteness of the process.

2.  **Energy Density Spectrum:** The energy density of a stochastic GW background, $\Omega_{GW}$, is related to the frequency $f$ and the source tensor $\Pi(k)$ (where $k=2\pi f$). For any causal process in the early universe, the energy density spectrum for modes that entered the horizon after the source became active scales with frequency as:
    $$\Omega_{GW}(f) = \frac{d\rho_{GW}}{d(\ln f)} \propto f^3 \int d\eta_1 d\eta_2 \, \frac{\cos(k(\eta_1 - \eta_2))}{a(\eta_1)a(\eta_2)} \Pi(k, \eta_1, \eta_2)$$
    For a white-noise source active over a short period (like geometrogenesis), the integral is approximately constant.

3.  **Prediction:** The resulting spectrum is strongly **blue-tilted**. The energy density grows with the cube of the frequency until it reaches a peak corresponding to the characteristic scale of the rewrite events (the effective Planck scale of the model).
    $$\Omega_{GW}(f) \propto f^3 \quad (\text{for } f < f_{\text{peak}})$$
    This stands in sharp contrast to the nearly scale-invariant ($n_t \approx 0$, meaning $\Omega_{GW} \propto f^0$) spectrum predicted by standard inflationary models. This distinctive spectral tilt toward high frequencies ($10^2 – 10^4$ Hz) makes it a prime target for terrestrial detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and the Einstein Telescope.

---

### **6.3 The Primordial CMB Dipole**

The standard interpretation holds that the CMB dipole is a purely kinematic effect. CLC allows for the possibility that a significant fraction of this dipole is of primordial cosmological origin.

**Derivation:**
1.  **Geometric Gradient:** The initial energic event—the formation of the first 3-cycle—breaks the perfect symmetry of the ZPI vacuum. If this nucleation event is not perfectly isotropic, it will establish a preferred direction in the early universe. This anisotropy is encoded as a large-scale gradient in the density of geometric information, $\rho_C = N_3/V$. We can represent this as a background vector field:
    $$\vec{G} = \langle \nabla \rho_C \rangle \neq 0$$

2.  **Effective Force:** In the emergent thermodynamic description (Part 5), a gradient in complexity acts as an effective force. This primordial gradient would induce a large-scale, coherent flow of emergent matter and energy.

3.  **Observable Consequence:** This flow would manifest today as a bulk velocity of our local group relative to the cosmic rest frame defined by the most distant parts of the graph. The CMB dipole we observe would thus be the sum of a local peculiar velocity and this primordial, cosmologically-induced flow. This hypothesis predicts that there should be subtle statistical anomalies (e.g., non-Gaussianities or alignments in other cosmological observables) correlated with the dipole direction, which would be absent if the dipole were purely kinematic.

---

### **6.4 The Entanglement Scaling Law**

The structure of the Global Register as a quantum error-correcting code (QECC) leads to a unique prediction for the scaling of entanglement entropy.

**Derivation:**
1.  **Holographic QECC Model:** We model the Global Register as an $[[N, k, d]]$ holographic QECC, where $N$ physical qubits in the bulk encode $k$ logical qubits on the boundary with a code distance $d$. We identify the $n$ 3-cycles within a stable bulk region as the physical qubits, so $N_{phys} = n$.

2.  **Code Distance:** A key feature of many holographic codes (e.g., the HaPPY code) is that the code distance, which measures the code's ability to resist errors, scales with the square root of the number of physical qubits:
    $$d \propto \sqrt{N_{phys}} = \sqrt{n}$$

3.  **Entanglement and the Ryu-Takayanagi Analogy:** In such codes, the entanglement entropy $S_{ent}$ between a contiguous subregion of $n_A$ qubits and its complement is proportional to the number of logical operators that cross the boundary, a quantity directly related to the code distance. This provides a discrete analogue of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, leading to the relation:
    $$S_{ent} \propto d$$

4.  **Prediction:** Combining these results yields a holographic scaling law for entanglement:
    $$S_{ent} \propto \sqrt{n}$$
    This is a distinctive prediction. A naive geometric area law for a 3D region of volume $V \propto n$ would predict an entropy scaling with the area $A \propto V^{2/3}$, giving $S \propto n^{2/3}$. The CLC prediction of $S_{ent} \propto n^{1/2}$ is a direct, testable consequence of the underlying QECC structure of spacetime.

---

### **6.5 Observational Distinctions & Experimental Timelines**

The following table summarizes the key observational differences between the predictions of Causal Loop Cosmology and standard inflationary models.

| Feature | **Causal Loop Cosmology (CLC)** | **Standard Inflation** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GW Spectrum Tilt** | Blue-tilted ($\Omega_{GW} \propto f^3$) | Nearly flat ($\Omega_{GW} \propto f^0$) |
| **Primary GW Band** | High-Frequency (LIGO/ET) | Low-Frequency (PTA/CMB) |
| **CMB Dipole Origin** | Potentially Primordial | Purely Kinematic |
| **Entanglement Scaling** | Holographic ($S_{ent} \propto n^{1/2}$) | Geometric Area Law ($S \propto n^{2/3}$) |

**Table 5:** Key observational distinctions between CLC and standard inflationary cosmology.

These predictions are testable on realistic timescales. The gravitational wave spectral tilt can be constrained by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's ongoing and future observing runs (2023-2027 and beyond). The primordial dipole hypothesis can be investigated through precision analysis of data from future CMB surveys like CMB-S4 (late 2020s).

---
# **Part 7: Discussion and Conclusion**

### **7.1 Synthesis, Comparison, and The Relational Universe**

Causal Loop Cosmology begins with a rejection of unproven assumptions. It presupposes no background spacetime, no pre-existing fields, and no external clock. It begins only with two axioms: that directed links encode causality and that 3-cycles are the minimal quanta of geometry.

From this foundation, we have shown that a specific logical architecture is required. The pre-geometric vacuum must be an acyclic, maximally symmetric Bethe lattice. Its evolution must proceed via maximal parallelism to preserve this symmetry. This parallel evolution, in turn, necessitates a holographic Global Register to ensure global consistency. We then demonstrated that this structure is not static. A single nucleation event triggers a thermodynamic phase transition, driving a rapid, inflationary expansion of geometric complexity. Extensive computational evidence from large-scale ensemble simulations (up to N≈5120) confirms that this S-curve of geometrogenesis is a universal feature, which terminates as the system's mean complexity saturates at a scale-invariant plateau of $\bar{N}_3 \approx 42$. The process results in a state consistent with a 4D manifold, with a scale factor $a(t) \propto \sqrt{N_3(t)}$. Finally, we derived the laws of physics as emergent properties of this manifold in three distinct limits, leading to a set of unique predictions, including a primordial origin for the CMB dipole, a blue-tilted gravitational wave spectrum, and a holographic entanglement scaling law.

This approach offers novel solutions to long-standing problems. Unlike standard inflation, CLC provides an intrinsic mechanism and a natural graceful exit. Unlike static models in quantum gravity, CLC is fundamentally dynamic and computational.


### **7.2 Future Work

Beyond the convergence to a 4D manifold, the choice of a Bethe lattice as the acyclic vacuum may have even deeper implications. This structure exhibits a remarkable dual geometry: its bulk connectivity is hyperbolic, creating a landscape suitable for matter to exist as localized, high-complexity defects. Simultaneously, its large-scale properties, when viewed through spectral analysis or via the Global Register, are those of a flat, Euclidean space. This duality is not a mathematical quirk; we believe it is the essential feature that allows a consistent physics to emerge.

We propose that this emergent flat space is the arena for emergent gauge fields, which could be modeled as local relational adjustments (e.g., edge modifications) that act as symmetries preserving the global manifold structure. While highly speculative, one could even frame the Bethe lattice itself as the first structure to emerge from a state of infinite symmetry (an "SU(0)" phase), a transition from the universal multi-pathway computational space of possibilities into a specific, ordered reality. This suggests a powerful, albeit distant, research program to derive not only spacetime but also its particle and force content from first principles.

## Appendix B: Formal Proofs

**Lemma 1 (Cycle Stability).**
> 1. A directed 2-cycle (\( A \to B \), \( B \to A \)) violates causality (\( A \not\prec A \)), hence is ruled out.
> 2. A directed cycle of length \( k > 3 \) decomposes into \( k-2 \) overlapping 3-cycles plus redundant edges; thus, 3-cycles are minimal for carrying geometric curvature without redundancy.

*Proof.*
(1) The causality primitive requires an irrevocable “before/after” distinction; a 2-cycle implies \( A \prec B \prec A \), which is a contradiction.
(2) For a \( k \)-cycle (\( k > 3 \)), triangulating edges (e.g., adding chords) yields \( k-2 \) directed 3-cycles. Additional edges create overlapping or redundant structures, increasing complexity. Thus, 3-cycles are the minimal closed loops preserving causal consistency and curvature.

*Proof of Theorem 1.*
(1) Acyclicity and connectivity imply \( G \) is a tree.
(2) Vertex-transitivity requires regularity: every vertex has degree \( b \). An infinite \( b \)-regular tree is \( \mathbb{T}_b \).
(3) Alternatives fail: adding an edge creates a cycle; non-regular trees break vertex-transitivity.
(4) For finite \( N \): A \( b \)-regular tree is impossible (since \( N(b-2) = -2 \) has no integer solutions for \( b \geq 3 \)). A Bethe fragment maximizes interior \( b \)-regularity while remaining acyclic.

*Proof of Theorem 2.*
(1) In the parallel case, \( \Phi \) applies \( \mathcal{R} \) simultaneously to all vertices. Since \( \phi \) maps neighborhoods isomorphically, \( \Phi \circ \phi = \phi \circ \Phi \), preserving symmetry.
(2) In the non-parallel case, let \( \sigma \) be a total order where \( v_i \) precedes \( v_j \). Since \( G_0 \) is finite and connected, there exists a path \( v_i \to w_1 \to \cdots \to w_k \to v_j \). The update at \( v_i \) may alter \( w_1 \)’s neighborhood, which alters \( w_2 \)’s, and so on, until \( v_j \) is evaluated on a modified graph. Thus, \( \mathcal{R}(v_j) \) sees a different local structure than \( \mathcal{R}(v_i) \), breaking symmetry. Light-cone or block-staggered schedulers impose asymmetric “before/after” structures, similarly violating commutativity.

**Lemma 2 (Correction Necessity).**
> Any inconsistency-detection scheme (e.g., checksums) without correction leads to halting (frozen dynamics) or error accumulation, contradicting continuous relational evolution. Correction is necessary.

*Proof.*
Detection signals inconsistent proposals (e.g., conflicting edges) but offers no resolution. Dropping proposals halts growth, violating continuous evolution (e.g., 3-cycle formation). Uncorrected errors cause regional divergence, breaking global consistency. A corrective mechanism restores valid states, ensuring continuity.
