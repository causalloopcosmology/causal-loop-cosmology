The SU(0) Phase and Gauge Field Emergence in Causal Loop Cosmology
Abstract
Causal Loop Cosmology (CLC) posits that spacetime emerges from a discrete, relational graph under a thermodynamically guided rewrite rule, as established in prior works \cite{fisher2025, fisher2025triad, fisher2025continuum}. This paper proposes a pre-geometric "SU(0)" phase—a null graph with infinite relational symmetry, identified as a limit of the Ruliad, Stephen Wolfram’s universal computational object \cite{wolfram2020}. We hypothesize that symmetry breaking from SU(0) seeds the Acyclic Vacuum (Bethe lattice), whose dual geometry—hyperbolic in the bulk (κ < 0), flat in the spectral/boundary frame (d_S → 4)—enables gauge-like fields as edge fluctuations preserving geometric invariants. The Bethe lattice, as a Ruliad subset, supports these fields via rulial foliations, with the Global Register enforcing consistency. We outline simulations to test this, extending Paper 3’s continuum limit to unify spacetime, matter, and gauge fields. This speculative framework leverages the Ruliad’s universality to contextualize CLC, offering falsifiable predictions for future validation.

1. Introduction
Causal Loop Cosmology (CLC) proposes that spacetime emerges from a discrete network of causal relations, without presupposing background geometry \cite{fisher2025}. Paper 1 demonstrated inflationary geometrogenesis, with a primordial 3-cycle triggering complexity that saturates at N_3 ≈ 42 \cite{fisher2025}. Paper 2 formalized the Necessary Triad—Acyclic Vacuum, Maximal Parallelism, Global Register—ensuring consistent evolution \cite{fisher2025triad}. Paper 3 anticipates a 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold via the Continuum Limit Conjecture (d_S → 4) \cite{fisher2025continuum}.
The Acyclic Vacuum, approximated by a finite Bethe lattice (b=3, girth > log_3 N), exhibits a unique dual geometry: hyperbolic in the bulk (κ < 0, V(r) ~ 2^r) and flat in the spectral/boundary frame (d_S → 4). This frame-dependent symmetry, absent in other graphs, suggests a capacity to support gauge fields. We hypothesize a pre-geometric SU(0) phase—a null graph with infinite symmetry, aligned with the Ruliad \cite{wolfram2020}—whose breaking seeds the Bethe lattice. As a Ruliad subset, the Bethe lattice’s geometry and dynamics enable gauge-like fields as edge fluctuations, complementing matter fields as topological defects.
This paper formalizes this speculation, situating CLC within the Ruliad’s universal framework. We define SU(0), explore the Bethe lattice’s dual geometry, propose gauge field emergence, and outline simulations, aiming to unify spacetime, matter, and gauge fields.
1.1 Motivation
The Ruliad’s universality, encapsulating all computational rules, provides a natural context for SU(0) as the ultimate symmetric state. The Bethe lattice’s dual geometry, as a Ruliad slice, supports gauge fields, paralleling U(1) invariance for photons and unifying with matter via defects.
2. The SU(0) Phase and the Ruliad
We define SU(0) as a pre-geometric state within the Ruliad, the universal object containing all possible computations \cite{wolfram2020}.
2.1 Definition
Definition 2.1 (SU(0) Phase): The SU(0) phase is a null graph, (\mathcal{G}_0 = (\emptyset, \emptyset)), with infinite relational symmetry, where all graph configurations and rules are equivalent. It corresponds to the Ruliad’s undifferentiated limit, containing all possible CLC graphs.
2.2 Symmetry Breaking
The transition from SU(0) to the Acyclic Vacuum (Bethe lattice) involves selecting a computational rule and initial condition:
[\mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}_1 = (V_1, E_1), \quad |V_1| = 1, \quad |E_1| = 0 \text{ or } 1.]
This breaks infinite symmetry, seeding a b=3 Bethe lattice via (\mathcal{R}). The Ruliad’s universality ensures all transitions are possible, with the Bethe lattice as a low-entropy path.
Conjecture 2.1 (SU(0) Transition): SU(0), as the Ruliad’s limit, transitions to the Bethe lattice via a symmetry-breaking event, selecting a b=3, acyclic rule within the Ruliad’s computational space.
3. Dual Geometry of the Bethe Lattice
The Bethe lattice’s dual geometry underpins gauge field emergence.
3.1 Hyperbolic Geometry
The Bethe lattice’s bulk is hyperbolic, with volume growth V(r) ~ 2^r (b=3), yielding negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature:
[\kappa(u,v) = 1 - \frac{W_1(m_u, m_v)}{d_{\text{graph}}(u,v)} < 0,]
supporting local dynamics (3-cycle formation) \cite{ollivier2009}.
3.2 Flat Geometry
In the spectral/boundary frame, the Bethe lattice is flat:

Spectral Dimension:[d_S(G_t) = -2 \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\log \langle P_v(t) \rangle_v}{\log t} \to 4.]
Boundary Projection: The Global Register projects bulk properties to a conformally flat boundary \cite{maldacena1998ads].

Lemma 3.1 (Dual Geometry): The Bethe lattice, as a Ruliad subset, exhibits hyperbolic geometry (κ < 0) in the bulk and flat geometry (d_S ≈ 4) in the spectral/boundary frame, reflecting different rulial foliations.
Proof Sketch: Hyperbolic geometry follows from V(r) ~ 2^r \cite{lin2011}. Flatness emerges via coarse-graining or holographic projection, as anticipated in Paper 3.
3.3 Ruliad Context
The dual geometry reflects the Ruliad’s multi-perspective nature, where different foliations yield hyperbolic or flat effective geometries, enabling gauge symmetries.
4. Gauge Field Emergence
Gauge-like fields emerge as edge fluctuations in the flat frame, preserving geometric invariants.
4.1 Gauge-Like Transformations
Define a gauge transformation:
[\mathcal{A}{uv} \to \mathcal{A}{uv} + \delta \phi_{uv}, \quad \sum_{uv \in E} \delta \phi_{uv} \cdot \rho_C = 0,]
where (\rho_C) is the 3-cycle density. These fluctuations mimic U(1) bosons \cite{ashtekar1986new}.
4.2 Role of the Global Register
The Global Register ensures fluctuations are syndrome-free, acting as a gauge-fixing mechanism \cite{kitaev2003fault}.
Conjecture 4.1 (Gauge Fields): Edge fluctuations in the flat frame, preserving N_3 ≈ 42, act as massless gauge fields, with dynamics encoded as Ruliad foliations.
4.3 Unification with Matter
Matter fields (deg(v) > 3 nodes) interact with gauge fields in the hyperbolic bulk, unified in the flat frame.

    num_flips = int(fraction * G.size())
    edges = list(G.edges(labels=False))
    for _ in range(num_flips):
        u, v = random.choice(edges)
        if G.has_edge(v, u):
            continue
        G_temp = G.copy()
        G_temp.add_edge(v, u)
        G_temp.delete_edge(u, v)
        n3_before = (G.to_undirected().adjacency_matrix()**3).trace() / 6
        n3_after = (G_temp.to_undirected().adjacency_matrix()**3).trace() / 6
        if abs(n3_after - n3_before) < 1e-6:
            G.add_edge(v, u)
            G.delete_edge(u, v)
    return G

7. Limitations and Future Work
SU(0) lacks dynamics, and the Ruliad perspective is speculative. Future work includes:

Formalizing SU(0) dynamics within the Ruliad.
Simulating gauge-matter interactions.
Developing a Hilbert space formulation.

8. Conclusion
The SU(0) phase, as the Ruliad’s limit, transitions to the Bethe lattice, whose dual geometry supports gauge fields as edge fluctuations. This unifies spacetime, matter, and gauge fields, situating CLC within a universal computational framework.
